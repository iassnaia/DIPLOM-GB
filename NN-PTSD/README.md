# Welcome to the stressDisorderClassification!

Yours stories can make you more helthy.

Let's look at some examples (story 2, story3, story4).

There are different, have their oun pluses and minuses. 

That means that parameters of these storys (of these clients) are different too. 

Thirstly it works because there are dependecies between clients and their stories.

Secondly it works because there are dependecies between stories and parameters.

If we know parameters, we know procent of our disorder level.

Then you can make the decign to be more healthy, if your health is bad, or don't do anything with your health, if it's good (for example).

Warning! This solver have row data and can be optimized.
## Installation

First of all get new dependecies for the project:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Repository have 3 stories: story 2, story 3, story 4.

Write in cmd to start: 
```bash
py stressDisorderClassification.py
```
After that writre number of the story (2-4).

Wait a few minutes and get the result.

## How it works

1. Story comes to slover algorithm.
2. Slover algorithm have special words to make decign what parameter will be active.
3. Parameters optimized from the ai formula named sigmoid function. 
4. Algorithm makes the division: Sum of parameters / Count of parameters. In result we have procent of our disoder level.
